# Real-Time-Prediction-of-Cardiovascular-Diseases-using-Deep-Learning-Model
The goal of this project is to accurately predict cardiovascular diseases in real-time using Deep Learning Networks by applying it on the collected health vitals data from the patients.
Cardio train .csv is the datset we used to analysed vital point that requires for predicting cardio vascular diseases
